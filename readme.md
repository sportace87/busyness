# Busyness

> Check if the external webcam on Mac is on and if I am on a call


## Purpose

This repo is actually a fork of [is-camera-on](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-camera-on). I have adapted the swift code to extract the external usb camera. 
This is only intended to be used locally. Also I have used the [is-camera-on-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-camera-on-cli).

## Requirements

Requires macOS 10.11 or later.
